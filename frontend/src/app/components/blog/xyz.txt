          <h2>HIGH AMOUNT OF NITROGEN </h2>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Plants like squash, cabbage, broccoli and corn use up large amounts of nitrogen while growing. <br>By
              growing
              these plants where there is too much nitrogen in soil, the plants will use up the excess nitrogen.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use mulch (wet grass) while growing crops. Mulch can also include sawdust and scrap soft wood. </li>

          <h2>LOW AMOUNT OF NITROGEN </h2>
          <ol>
  
            <li>Use manures with high N-concentration. In particular, blood meal, groundnut husks and cake, coco peat
              are
              much richer in nitrogen compared to coal or wood ash and fresh poultry or green cowpea manure.
            </li>
            <li>Cover crops, crop rotation as well as intercropping help prevent nitrogen deficiency by growing legumes.
            </li>
            <li>
              using synthesized N-containing fertilizers to promote crop recovery from nitrogen deficiency, e.g. NPK, 
  nitrolime, ammonium nitrate, urea, etc. Soil testing before a cropping season will help understand the required 
  corrections of pH and nutrient content.

          <h2>HIGH AMOUNT OF POTASSIUM </h2>
          <ol>
  <li>
  Stop applying potassium-rich commercial fertilizer. Apply only commercial fertilizer that has a '0' in the final number field.
  Commercial fertilizers use a three number system for measuring levels of nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium. The last number stands for potassium. 
  Another option is to stop using commercial fertilizers all together and to begin using only organic matter to enrich the soil.
  </li>
            <li>Grow a cover crop of legumes that will fix nitrogen in the soil. This practice will meet the soil’s needs for nitrogen without increasing phosphorus or potassium.
            </li>
            <li>Use NPK fertilizers with low K levels and organic fertilizers since they have low NPK values.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix crushed eggshells, crushed seashells, wood ash or soft rock phosphate to the soil to add calcium. Mix in up to 10 percent of organic compost to help amend and balance the soil.

            <li>Mix in muricate of potash or sulphate of potash.
            </li>
            <li>Try kelp meal, seaweed or Sul-Po-Mag.

              Bury banana peels an inch below the soils surface.

            <li>
              Use Potash fertilizers since they contain high values potassium.

          <h2>HIGH AMOUNT OF PHOSPHORUS </h2>
          <ol>
  
            <li>
              Avoid adding manure though it contains many key nutrients for your soil but typically including high levels of phosphorous.
   Limiting the addition of manure will help reduce phosphorus being added.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use only phosphorus-free fertilizer – if you can limit the amount of phosphorous added to your soil, you can let the plants use the existing phosphorus 
  while still providing other key nutrients such as Nitrogen and Potassium. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Plant nitrogen fixing vegetables to increase nitrogen without increasing phosphorous (like beans and peas).
            </li>
            <li>
              Use crop rotations to decrease high phosphorous levels.
            </li>
            <li>
              Find a fertilizer with numbers such as 10-0-10, where the zero represents no phosphorous.
            </li>
            <li>
              Water your soil – soaking your soil liberally will aid in driving phosphorous out of the soil.
            </li>
          </ol>

          <ol>
  
            <li>
              Bone meal – a fast acting source that is made from ground animal bones which is rich in phosphorous.
            </li>
            <li>
              Rock phosphate – a slower acting source where the soil needs to convert the rock phosphate into phosphorous that the plants can use.
            </li>
            <li>
              Phosphorus Fertilizers – applying a fertilizer with a high phosphorous content in the NPK ratio
   (example: 10-20-10, 20 being phosphorous percentage).
            </li>
            <li>
              Clay soil – introducing clay particles into your soil can help retain & fix phosphorus deficiencies.
            </li>
            <li>
              Organic compost – adding quality organic compost to your soil will help increase phosphorous content.
